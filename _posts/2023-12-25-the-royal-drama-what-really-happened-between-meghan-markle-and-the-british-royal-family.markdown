### First Impressions 
When Meghan Markle first joined the British royal family by marrying Prince Harry in 2018, she was viewed by many as a breath of fresh air that would help modernize and diversify the centuries-old institution. However, it didn't take long before rumors of discord started swirling. While the royal family prides itself on over 1000 years of tradition and protocol, Meghan struggled to adapt to their strict rules and expectations. Her naturally confident and independent personality was perceived by some as disrespectful to royal customs.

### Clashing Cultures  
The differences between American and British cultures also contributed to tensions. As an American actress accustomed to speaking her mind, Meghan had a harder time grasping the notion that royal family members must remain politically neutral and avoid controversy at all costs. Meanwhile, some felt that Meghan wanted the royal family to conform to her worldview rather than the other way around. The clash between Meghan's progressive Californian upbringing versus the establishment traditions of the royal household created friction from the start.
### Personality Clashes Behind Closed Doors
Behind palace walls, it seems Meghan rubbed some royals the wrong way with her bold personality and desire to modernize the monarchy's [outdated protocols](https://yt.io.vn/collection/alegre). Rumors swirled that she and Kate Middleton weren't getting along due to reports of Meghan making Kate cry during a bridesmaid dress fitting. There were also stories of Meghan being difficult with palace staff. While the details are still private, it's clear that Meghan's strong personality did not mesh well with the more reserved dispositions of some royals like Princess Anne who value tradition above all else.
### Stepping Back for "Peace" 
In early 2020, Harry and Meghan made the bombshell announcement that they would be stepping back from their senior royal duties in pursuit of more financial and personal freedom. While they said it was to find a "peaceful life" away from the British tabloids, many saw it as an escape from the rigid restraints of royal life that Meghan was struggling to accept. The couple moved to California soon after, severing most official royal ties in the process. However, their shock departure also damaged Harry's relationship with his family back home.
### Speaking Out Sparks Backlash
Seeking media attention and lucrative deals in America, Harry and Meghan gave a bombshell interview to Oprah Winfrey in 2021 where they levied serious accusations against the royal family. They claimed an unnamed royal expressed "concerns" about Archie's skin color and alleged Meghan received no support for her mental health struggles. However, their public bashing of the institution that had once embraced Meghan was not well received in the UK. It further soured their relations with the royal household and positioned them as exiles in their own country.
### Long-Term Impacts on the Monarchy
The lasting fallout from "Megxit" still divides opinions today. While some respect Harry for prioritizing his wife and mental health, others see it as a betrayal. Meanwhile, the monarchy faces new challenges balancing tradition with modern relevance. The race and gender diversity Meghan represented created hope for a more progressive royal brand abroad. However, their high-profile schism shows that dramatically shifting a 1000-year institution is no simple task. As republican sentiments emerge, the future of the throne remains uncertain as it walks the delicate line between preserving history and embracing change.
