### The Struggle to Conceive
My parents struggled for years to have a child. This was during a time before fertility specialists were widely established. My mother went through several painful attempts, including ovarian cysts, an ectopic pregnancy, a spontaneous abortion, and stillbirth. It was a biblical struggle for her to fulfil her longing to nurture a child. 
Despite her small stature, my mother stood tall on the high road through many challenges in life with compassion and respect. However, realizing her dreams of motherhood seemed an increasingly difficult battle as she grew older. It was looking like her odyssey may end in defeat.

### A Dedicated Doctor Makes a Difference
Then my parents met Dr. Gluck, a exceptionally [bright and focused physician](https://yt.io.vn/collection/aber). As the top of his class, he was committed to applying his knowledge to help others. Dr. Gluck took on my mother's case with dedication. Under his care, she started taking experimental **female fertility hormones** that were just emerging in medical research at that time. 
My father meticulously recorded my mother's hormone levels from urine samples each day. They worked closely with Dr. Gluck to try this new approach, knowing the risks were still unknown but hoping it could fulfill my mother's dream. After several attempts, it finally succeeded with me. I owe my very existence to the perseverance of my parents and Dr. Gluck's pioneering work.
### A Difficult Birth and Recovery  
However, my entry into this world was not easy either. Due to my mother's small frame, she needed an emergency **C-section delivery** to safely deliver me. This surgical procedure left her vulnerable to future complications. Later in life, she developed intestinal obstructions that were linked to her prior surgery, which I felt immense guilt over.  
The postpartum recovery was also grueling for my mother. She faced challenges like painful scar tissue and difficulty caring for a newborn. But her love and dedication to nurturing me gave her the strength to push through every struggle.
### Mother's Sacrifice and Its Consequences   
Tragically, the fertility hormones my mother took may have contributed to her later developing aggressive breast cancer. When I learned this possibility, I felt even more deeply indebted to her sacrifice which brought me into this world but also endangered her health. She fought bravely but ultimately lost her battle with cancer.  
My father also carried guilt about not detecting her cancer sooner. They both gave so much to have me, and I will forever cherish the precious time we had together as a family, however brief it was. Her memory inspires me to make the most of this life and pass on her nurturing spirit.
### Finding Purpose After Loss
In the darkness after losing my mother, I turned to reflecting on medical research to find purpose. I came across my father's meticulous records of my mother's fertility treatment, which were pioneering for their time. So much has been discovered since then about women's health and **fertility treatment options**. 
I was determined to honour my parents' legacy by advancing this important field. I became inspired to study medicine myself with a focus on obstetrics and gynecology. Though the path was long, I knew this was a way to give back for the gift of life they sacrificed so much to bring me.
### Starting Medical School
I was accepted to one of the top medical schools in the country. The first year was overwhelming with the intense workload but I immersed myself fully. Late nights were spent absorbed in thick textbooks covering topics from anatomy to biochemistry. 
Weekends were for catching up on missed sleep and meals. During breaks, I visited my father who was proud yet lonely without my mother. His health was declining too from years of illness and grief. Those moments strengthened my resolve to excel in my studies.
### Early Clinical Experiences 
As the years went on, I shifted from intensive textbook learning to hands-on clinical training. Rotations in OBGYN especially sparked my passion. I was moved by assisting deliveries, caring for expectant mothers, and helping to address women's health issues.
One patient's **fertility journey** mirrored my mother's struggle. Providing emotional support through her various treatments deeply resonated with me. In another dramatic scenario, I was part of an emergency team that performed an emergency **C-section delivery** to save both mother and baby's lives. Experiences like that reinforced why I chose this path.
### Finding Inner Healing Through Service  
Helping others through difficult medical situations served as a balm to my own heartaches. As I neared the end of training, I felt ready to take the next step as a fully fledged physician. An opportunity arose for an OBGYN position at a rural community hospital, which had limited specialist care. 
I knew this was where I was meant to be to make the biggest difference. While private practices in bigger cities offered more comforts, fulfilling my duty to serve underprivileged populations felt most aligned with my calling. It has brought me fulfillment everyday since.
### Carrying On a Legacy of Hope
In the years that have passed, I have supported countless families on their journeys to parenthood, whether through fertility treatments, prenatal care, or deliveries. So many of my patients' smiling children running around now remind me of the hope I once represented. 
There are also bittersweet moments that stir memories of my mother, like holding a newborn or diagnosing breast cancer. But I take comfort knowing she would be proud to see me paying forward the gift of life. Every success story keeps alive the legacy of perseverance from my parents and Dr. Gluck. Their hope continues living on through me.
