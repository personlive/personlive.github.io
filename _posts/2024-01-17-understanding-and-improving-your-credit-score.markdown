## What Goes into Your Credit Score
Your [FICO credit score](https://yt.io.vn/collection/aldrete) is calculated based on key factors in your credit report from the three major credit bureaus - Equifax, Experian and TransUnion. Each bureau has its own version of the FICO model, but the factors that influence your score are consistent across all three. 
If your credit score is currently below 600, your credit report likely contains some combination of the following characteristics that are dragging your score down:
- Recent history of delinquent or late payments on accounts
- Currently delinquent accounts, including accounts in collection status 
- High credit card balances above 30% of the available credit limit
- Public records like bankruptcies, foreclosures, liens or judgements
Your score is impacted both by negative items and how long ago they occurred. Older delinquencies and collections will have less of an effect over time as they age on your credit report. Taking quick action to improve recent issues can provide a noticeable boost.
## Fixing Late Payments and Delinquent Accounts
**Pay late bills on time going forward** to avoid further harm. Past late payments will gradually weigh less as more on-time payments are reported. Paying past due accounts in full brings them back to current status and raises your score. 
For accounts in collections, you may be able to settle for less than the full amount owed. Ask the collection agency if they'll remove the account from your credit report in exchange. Otherwise, leave long-dormant collections alone unless pursued for payment, as reopening the issue could lower your score.
### Negotiating with creditors and collectors 
Creditors and collection agencies have an incentive to work with borrowers, as payment or settlement is preferable to no resolution. Communicate openly about your situation and ability to pay, while also standing firm on reasonable terms. Compromise may lead to removing or updating negative items to boost your credit standing over time.

## Reducing Credit Utilization and Balances
One of the most impactful ways to improve your credit score is reducing your credit utilization ratio, which is the portion of your available revolving credit that is in use. Aim to keep all credit card balances below 30% of the credit limit. 
Paying down high card balances brings immediate score gains, as lenders see lower risk of default. For the greatest benefit, pay statement balances in full each month to report $0 debt while maintaining credit availability. This strategy avoids interest charges while establishing a positive credit history.
### Lowering debt strategically 
First, stop adding to existing debt balances through new purchases. Then, focus extra payments on cards with the highest rates or minimum payments to eliminate accounts most quickly. Building momentum with early wins motivates continuing progress to become debt-free. Maintaining utilization below 10% shows optimal credit management to lenders.
## Reviewing and Disputing Credit Report Errors
To fix credit report mistakes, you must first inspect what is reported about your credit history. Federal law entitles each consumer to one free credit report annually from each of the three bureaus. 
Review reports closely for discrepancies compared to your own financial records. Common errors include mishandled identity details, incorrect account balances or status, and items reporting to the wrong person. Dispute issues in writing to trigger an investigation.
### Pursuing credit reporting disputes 
Include your full name, current and prior addresses, Social Security number or government ID, date of birth, phone number, and a detailed explanation of the disputed item, along with any documentation proving your case. The bureaus must research within 30 days and notify you of the results. Unverified errors must be removed to prevent further score impact.
If disputes are denied, a consumer statement may be added to present your side. Consider also contacting the data furnisher originally reporting the information to check and correct their records. Persistence is key to overcoming credit report inaccuracies through the dispute process. 
## Strategies for Raising Low Credit Scores Over Time

## Options for Credit Building with Bad Credit 
If your scores remain very low, traditional credit may reject applications. But rebuilding options exist even with damaged credit. 
### Secured credit cards for rebuilding
Secured cards require a refundable security deposit as collateral, usually equal to the credit limit. Use and pay on time like a regular card reports positive data and opens the door to graduating to unsecured cards down the line. These lower-risk starter products expand available credit while proving responsible usage habits. 
Alternative lines of credit from non-bank lenders may also accept subprime applicants, though rates tend higher than standard cards. As scores lift over 6-12 months of on-time repayments, expand or transition credit sources to push rebuilding further. Have patience - gains will follow consistency.

For very damaged credit, outside assistance complements self-help towards ultimate credit restoration goals. 
## Maintaining Hard-Won Credit Gains Long Term
Reaching target credit scores signifies turning a corner towards greater access and lower costs of capital. Yet repaired credit still requires maintenance for sustained benefit over years to come. Continuing the financial foundation built positions consumers well for their financial futures.
### Protecting rebuilt credit health
Monitor reports regularly for signs of identity theft promptly solved through dispute resolution. Manage minimum payments responsibly juggling daily finances. Research major loan and credit applications thoroughly comprehending terms impacting debt and utilization before committing long-term.
