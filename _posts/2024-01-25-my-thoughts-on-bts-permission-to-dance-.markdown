While "Permission to Dance" brought joy to many, as a longtime fan, I've had mixed feelings about BTS' recent shift in musical direction. Here are my thoughts on the song and where I hope to see BTS go next.
### A Summer Bop, But No Depth  
PTD is catchy and uplifting, serving its purpose as a summer dance track. However, the lyrics lack the depth fans have come to expect from BTS. [Meaningful lyrics](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/aggarwal) have always been central to their appeal, so this switch was disappointing. The song feels generic compared to earlier works exploring important social issues.

### Too Much Autotune
The heavy **autotune usage** took away from members' unique voices. Autotune enhances tracks like "Black Swan" but detracted from PTD. Their vocals don't need covering - fans love BTS for their raw talent. The processed sound felt inauthentic compared to their usual style. 
### A Disconnect Between Sound and Style
The wild western theme seemed randomly chosen and didn't match the upbeat pop sound. Past MVs brilliantly blended **concept and music**. This disconnect was jarring. I wanted a concept truly embodying the song's message of togetherness through dancing instead of seeming like a marketing gimmick.
### Where Was the Rap Line?
As talented rappers, leaving J-Hope, RM, and Suga only to sing disappointed fans. Their flows are a hallmark of BTS. An English rap section could have thrilled international audiences unfamiliar with their impressive skills. The total lack of rap seemed a wasted opportunity to showcase BTS' full abilities.
### Aiming for Commercial Success Over Artistry  
It's understandable that BTS wishes to find mainstream popularity abroad. However, constant switches to the **"Hot 100 formula"** risk losing what made fans love them - heartfelt lyrics, complex concepts, and rap dominance. Chasing awards shouldn't come at the cost of the **meaningful artistic expression** that propelled them to the top. 
### Fans Want to See BTS' True Selves
While new fans may enjoy the bright pop sound, long-time supporters long to see BTS' authentic Korean talents shine, not just attempts to break records. We fell for who they **naturally are as artists,** not a packaged Western image. I hope future releases allow their full personalities to shine through instead of conforming to popularity formulas.
### Striking a Balance is Key
BTS shouldn't stop experimenting but find balance. Occasional English singles are fine, yet most hoped for a return to deeper Korean material by now. If future projects blend **commercial appeal** and **artistic passion**, allowing full member participation, BTS could satisfy both goals of expanding globally and keeping dedicated fans happy. With moderation and heart, both can be achieved. 
### In Closing...
As with any beloved group's artistic evolution, change sparks complex feelings. While new directions broaden their horizons, longtime fans yearn for a return to roots. BTS' future success relies on honoring fans who made them by showcasing the magic that caught our hearts initially - their raw talent, thoughtful messages and Korean soul. With care taken to balance artistic expression and commercial aims, BTS can continue ascending to new heights.
#Content input: Here are some more thoughts I have on BTS' new English songs and music direction:
- One problem I have is that the English songs don't feel like BTS songs. They don't incorporate the members' personalities or unique talents. The songs are very generic pop rather than having BTS' signature style. 
- I miss hearing complex, metaphorical and socially conscious lyrics. The English songs focus more on being catchy rather than sending a meaningful message. 
- The rapline gets shortchanged in the English songs. They barley get any rap verses. The songs would be more interesting if they incorporated different styles like hip hop or R&B rather than just bright pop.
- I'm worried the constant focus on the Billboard Hot 100 is distracting BTS from focusing on their art. Chasing commercial success in the West seems to be the main priority rather than creativity. 
- It would be nice if they mixed in some English versions of their older Korean songs to appeal to international fans rather than just generic pop tracks. Songs like Fake Love or Black Swan in English could blow people away. 
- I understand the appeal of broadening their audience but it feels like they are losing parts of their identity to achieve mainstream popularity. Their earlier unique sound is what made them stand out from other groups. 
- Longtime fans are feeling frustrated that BTS seems to be going in a more commercial direction rather than the authentic artistic path that gained them popularity initially. There needs to be a balance.

### Forging a New Identity or Losing Touch with Their Roots?
One of the major concerns longtime fans like myself have is whether BTS' recent string of bright, casual English pop songs signals a shift away from the artistic identity that first captivated listeners. Their calculated moves for commercial dominance in the West seem to come at the cost of creativity and nuance fans grew to love. 
A key complaint is the lack of the members' individuality and personality shining through in these tracks. Dynamite, Butter and Permission to Dance feel overly generic instead of showcasing BTS' trademark versatile and emotive styles. The rapline in particular gets shortchanged, with barely any rap verses to flex their skills. This homogenized sound dilutes what makes BTS unique.
Fans yearn for BTS to flex their artistry instead of conforming to formulas. Complex, metaphor-rich lyrics packed with **socio-political messages** have always been central to their artistry. The emphasis on being commercially "**Hot 100 friendly**" sacrifices using music as a medium for meaningful self-expression. Reducing their discography to saccharine hooks risks detaching from the thoughtful image cultivation that propelled them to the top.
An obvious compromise would be releasing polished **English versions** of past hit songs, as many new fans are unfamiliar with their immense Korean catalog. Imagining emotive translations of tracks like "Black Swan," "Fake Love" or "IDOL" into English could bring that signature BTS flavor while gaining new appreciation abroad. Simply remaking songs proven successful at home seems a safer choice than debuting unrelated temporary pop productions. 
The persistent pursuit of awards also gives impression that accolades now dictate career direction over passion. Chasing short-term commercial "wins" risks long-term authenticity if members seem confined instead of freely exploring diverse genres. A balance keeping the integrity of BTS' artistry while cautiously experimenting globally seems the healthier approach. 
Longtime supporters invested in BTS for their genuine reflections on self-identity, society and human nature packaged in innovative, genre-blending productions. Losing touch with these **artistic roots** to chase Western praise risks bitterness from fans who feel misled. I hope BTS can strike the right equilibrium honoring past and future listeners by incorporating personality into releases regardless of language. 
With each new project, the line between broadening horizons and sacrificing one's core talents grows thinner. BTS navigating this tightrope walk will determine if they maintain relevance through evolution or fade by chasing fleeting fads. Having conquered Korea, the question remains - can BTS truly dominate globally without diluting the authentic qualities making their ascension so inspiring in the first place? Only time will tell if BTS' bright future balances commercial success with the artistic passion of their beginnings.
#Content input: Here are a few more points I wanted to add:
- It would be interesting to see BTS try releasing songs in different genres besides just pop, like R&B, hip hop or ballads to show their range. 
- The producers they've been working with in the West don't utilize their full talents as well as their Korean producers who know them better. 
- Catering completely to the Western market means copying trends instead of setting them. Their earlier unconventional concepts are what made them stand out.
- ARMYs have spent years getting to know each member as individuals. The newer, more generic title track promotions don't highlight each persons colors as well. 
- BTS achieved so much by being true to themselves rather than changing to follow trends. I hope they don't lose sight of that to chase records. 
- Their Japanese releases show it's possible to balance artistic expression and commercial success without compromising their identity.

### Showcasing Their Diverse Talents  
In addition to relying on saccharine pop formulas, another criticism is BTS' limited exploration of genres in their recent English output. While catchy songs are important for market dominance, restricting their sound risks underselling the members' extensive abilities. 
BTS have proven mastery of arrays of styles - from ballads displaying emotional nuance to hardcore hip hop flexing rap dexterity. Yet the past few titles predominantly stick to breezy pop. Stepping outside the box could yield refreshing surprises for listeners. 
Imagine soulful R&B tunes highlighting vocal melodies, or moody hip hop tracks letting the rapline flex intricate flows. Electronic anthems, rock-tinged ballads, Latin-inspired jams - the options to showcase versatility are endless. Collaborating with producers open to experimentation beyond trends may help BTS craft unique masterpieces truly emphasizing their strengths.
